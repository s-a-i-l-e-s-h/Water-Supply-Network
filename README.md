# Water-Supply-Network
Creating a water metering system for real-time monitoring of water consumption, quality, and volume stands as a critical endeavor. The system necessitates the incorporation of sensors capable of conducting physical, chemical, and biological analyses to uphold standards of both quantity and quality. Moreover, it should facilitate ongoing updates and administration of water quality assessments. By integrating IoT sensors and real-time monitoring functionalities into a mapping tool, the system can swiftly identify irregularities, leaks, or fluctuations in water pressure. This data must be readily accessible in real-time to pertinent authorities. Additionally, an alert mechanism should be implemented to notify relevant stakeholders, including water authorities, maintenance crews, and residents, upon detection of anomalies or issues, ensuring prompt response and resolution.
